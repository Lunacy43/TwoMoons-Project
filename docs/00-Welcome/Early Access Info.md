# Early Access Info
________________________________________
________________________________________

â€‹This project is currently in Early Access. Things will continue to be altered and updated over time.

### Who are you?
Hello. This is the owner of EnKryptic Labs. Online I prefer to go by the name GatoNya. I'm a college graduate with degrees in Graphic Design and Sound Engineering. 

### What is the TwoMoons Project?
TwoMoons is a project I've been working on for quite some time. As an undergraduate, I was inspired to create my own tabletop game. After many playtests and revisions, I decided it was time to expand scope and share my creation online.

### Where are you development-wise?
I'm still on the testing stage of Game Development. I would say the project is still in Alpha because while many bugs and exploits were worked out or removed, there are certain interactions I was unable to test out within playtests.

### When will the project be finished?
There is no set date for when the project will finish (an official 1.0 version). I do have a set of additions that will be added over time until the project reaches a "finished" state.

#### Will there be a book?
I would love to publish a physical book for TwoMoons. However until the project is in a finished state and I have the funds to do so, my answer is "No".

#### Will there be merchandise?
I plan to set up merchandise in the future, even if its something as simple as stickers (but I'd love to make and sell posters and plushies).
