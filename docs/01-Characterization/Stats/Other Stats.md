# Other Stats

## **Impulsiveness**
Calculation: INS(M)-WIL(M)

A character’s likelihood to follow through with an impulsive thought or action.  Impulsiveness stems from INS but is tempered by WIL.

## **Body Stabilization Index**
 Body Stabilization Index (BSI) = CON(B)
-	Residue:
	-	Items you consume contain “residue”
	-	Residue reduces your BSI
-	Unstable:
	-	When your BSI reaches zero, you become “Unstable”.
	-	While Unstable, Foodborne Illness takes effect and any edible consumed has a chance of doing something not intended.
-	Poison
	-	BSI blocks PoisonDamage: \[Poison] - \[BSI] = \[Damage]
	-	Negative BSI does not add to PoisonDamage
-	Residue removal
	-	Rest can remove a certain amount of Residue/restore a certain amount of BSI
	-	BSI can also be restored via detox like consumables

## **Focus**
You gain Focus (FCS) from the class you choose.  
You can add the specified Stat (M) to increase an actions Accuracy (ACC: chance to hit) or increase an actions Power (PWR: damage and effectiveness). You cannot use FCS Stat for both rolls.

## **Movement Speed**
For each movement type, 5 experience points equal 1 unit ( \[5 (B) = 1 (M)] ). There are 5 different movement types:
-	Ground - basic movement on land
-	Swim - speed moving through the water.
-	Burrow - digging through the ground, usually uses 1 Stamina per unit
-	Climb - speed of climbing action
-	Flight - speed moving through the air. Glide and hover use this, you just cannot go up.

Note: 1 unit = 1 Meter / ~3 Feet

## **Concentration**
Usually used for long-form attacks and abilities
Usual roll: 1d100+WIL(M)
-	Roll over a certain value to keep concentration on task
-	fail roll and concentration breaks, ending task

## **Special Effects**

Base Info:
-	An effect that activates under certain condition (usually through a roll)
-	Modifier: 4 (B)Stat = 1 (M)Stat
-	Each damage type has a Special Effect automatically assigned to it
	-	Effects always apply on crits.
		-	When this happens, if the attack has more than 1 damage type, choose what effect is activated and roll for chance to activate another damage effect.

Damage Effect Rolls
-   All but 1 damage type have special effect/condition connected to them when certain conditions are met
-   To activate a Special Effect:
	-	Get a crit
	-	Get a collective 100 or higher from a 1d100+\[RE].
-   You can only activate 1 damage type at a time unless the original action roll crit itself (an attack roll or instance).

When attempting to activate a Special Effect with SE stats from your character, choose 1 of the following:
-   Roll:
	-   Roll 1d10 per 10 SE Value starting at 1d10.
	-	Roll is the highest extra value you can add. If the roll is over Modified value, your limit is the Modified value.
-   Auto-Roll:
	-   Auto-roll half of the Modifier (rounded down)

## **Resistance Chance**

Base Info:
-	Stats towards chance of blocking damage or removing conditions
-	When facing incoming damage or conditions that you have resistance against:
	-	Roll 1d10 per 10(M) starting at 1d10. (if modifier is below 10, roll a 1d10)
	-	Roll is the highest extra damage you can add. If roll is over stat, your limit is the stat #.
-	Modifier
	-	4 (B)Stat = 1 (M)Stat
	-	If a modifier for a Resistance Chance is negative, it is seen as 0
-	Immunity
	-	Damage: Incoming damage reduced to one(1)
	-	Condition: incoming automatically Nullified
	
​  
When attempting to use a Resistance Chance stat from your character, choose 1 of the following:
-	Roll:
	-	Roll for each Resistance Chance instance used
	-	Roll 1d10 per 10 Resistance Chance Value starting at 1d10.
	-	Roll is the highest extra value you can add. If the roll is over Modified value, your limit is the Modified value.
-	Auto-Roll:
	-	Auto-roll half of the Modifier (rounded down)

Note: When dealing with various forms of Block, calculate accordingly; add Resistance Chance (Damage) to active Armor/Item Block for total Block amount
