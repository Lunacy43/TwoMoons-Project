# Health and Vitality
________________________________________
________________________________________

## **Maximum HP**  
Calculation = CON(B)+\[Level×10]  
Max Stat: 200+300 = 500  

There is your Max Health and your Current Health; keep track of both.

## **Jammed HP**  
Artificially decreases MaxHP. There are several different kinds of Jam that interact with HP in different ways:
-   Wither
	-   Resistance Chance (Condition): True
	-   Basics
		-   Apply up to 20 Jam(medHP) per Application
	-   HP
		-   \# = new health limit
		-   If current HP goes under Jam-Wither, you enter limbo
			-   If you current HP goes above Wither #, you exit the wither-induced limbo
			-   If wither # decreases, you may exit wither-induced limbo

-   Shine
	-   Resistance Chance (Condition): False
	-   Basics
		-   A type of Jam applied under special means
		-   Cannot be removed; Effect ends in 24 in-game hours after application
			-   Must include a long rest
	-   HP
		-   \# = new health limit
		-   If current HP goes under Jam-Shine, you die (revive possible)

Note: Treat each Jammed HP type as separate from each other unless otherwise stated

## **Health Regen**
Health can be regained through:
-   Resting
-   Use of healing abilities
-   Use of Lifesteal
-   Health restoring edibles

## **LIMBO**
Upon taking Lethal damage enter Limbo
-   Each time you take damage, roll to Death Defy
	-   Roll 1d100 + \[Survival (Skill)]
		-   Need 30 or above to not die
		-   Each successful Death Defy roll raises Stress by 5
		-   Rolls can still happen while Asleep or Unconscious
-   GIVE UP: If you take lethal damage and don’t want to go into Limbo, or if you’re already in Limbo and just want to die, you can

## **Revival Cost**
With GameMasters permission (and if the player’s death was not by STRESS), players can be revived. However, players have negative points of 20 per number of deaths. For example, a second death result in a reduction of 40 total Base points. Negative points are then used on the following:
-   Core Stats
-   Skills
-   Resistance Chance (Damage and Condition)
-   Movement Speed
-   Special Effects
-   Languages
-   Spirit
