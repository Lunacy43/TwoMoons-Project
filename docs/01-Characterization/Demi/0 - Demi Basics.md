## Main
Demitypes (or Demis) are bonus/alternate Demographics a character can have. 

Demis are separated into groups: Borne-Only, Post-Death, and Other. 
-	“Born-Only” demis are only available in Character Creation. The characters have had these demis since the start of their lives.
-	“Post-Death” demis are only available after the character has officially died and taken a death tax (reduction of points on death)
-	“Other” demis can be obtained outside of the latter two prerequisites, though some may have major restrictions on how it may be obtained.

A character can have more than one Demi, under certain rules:
-	Follow Genetic Inclusion rules
-	A character can have multiple Borne-Only Demis 
-	A character can have more than one Post-Death Demi (including in character creation) so long as the death tax is paid
