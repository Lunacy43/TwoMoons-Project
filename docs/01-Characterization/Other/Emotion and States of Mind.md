# Emotion and States of Mind
________________________________________
________________________________________

# Basics:
**Basic Rules**
- There are 8 base emotions, each with 3 SoM (States of Mind) within them.
- These SoM are in 3 categories: Good (positive), Mixed, Bad (negative).
	- The SoM are also numbered 1-3
- An entity can only have 1 SoM on them at a time
- Applied SoM are treated as Conditions with \[Resistance Chance (Condition): True] unless stated otherwise

**Application and Removal**
- When rolling to apply a SoM, choose which tree then roll a 1d4.
	- The die number will correspond with the SoM number (1 - 3)
	- if die number is not one of the SoM numbers, then reroll.
- To clear a SoM, you must roll a 20 or lower (1d100)

**Character Creation Emotion Selection (Immunity)**
- In Character creation, choose one of the 8 base emotions.
- Character is now immune to the SoM of that emotion
