## Gaining and Losing Points
-	Base:
	-	 Both your Virtue and Vice start out at 10 when starting your character in play.
	-	The max Vice or Virtue you can have is 20, with the lowest being 0.
-	 V point fluctuations
	-	Acting on a Main Virtue will give you +1 point towards total Virtue or gain a Roll Charge. Acting on its opposite will give you -1 towards total Virtue or remove a Roll Charge. Same can be said of Main Vices. 
-	GameMaster Ruling
	-	While Vice and Virtue prompts are offered above, the Players and ultimately the GameMaster can choose what actions are seen as successful (or at least notable) “V” prompts
