## Main Info

### Basics

**Rarity**:
-   How often people in the world will encounter the material;
could also reflect how “legal” a material is to obtain
-   5 tiers:
	-   1 = common
	-   2 = uncommon
	-   3 = rare
	-   4 = legendary
	-   5 = mythic

**Type**:
-   what the material is/is made of
-   several types:
	-   metallic = matter made of metallic based minerals
	-   non-metallic = non-biotic matter made of nonmetallic minerals
	-   organic = biotic/cellular matter
	-   synthetic = man-made material
	-   exotic = matter of unusual properties

**Armor:** 
-   Flat damage the material can block   
-   Mainly used for armor and items with Block abilities  
-   Max value: 
	-   50 (for single damage type)
	-   100 (for multiple damage types)

**Mending Damage**:  
-   The amount of possible damage the item will take if mended

**Augments**:  
-   Properties not original to the material
-   Enchantments: special properties added to material at the cost of the material’s durability

### Durability
**Basics**
-   The material’s ability to withstand damage  
-   Max value: 100 

**Item Creation**: 
- ​Durability on creation equal to 1d100 roll (unless otherwise stated)

**​Normal Durability Loss:**
-   Damage over armor = \[-1] durability  
-   Damage over armor counts once per instance
	-   This is to make items last longer due to high damage scaling and combo damage

**Targeted Item**  
-   Entities can target individual items and wearable pieces of others  
-   When these items take damage they lose 1 durability equal the # of times the damage exceeds the item's block amount.
	-   For example, if the damage is 3 times the block amount, it loses 3 durability

### Material Properties  
The original effects within the material itself
-   Abrasive Touch:  rubbing against the material the wrong way will cut you
-   Adaptation: alters self-mods to certain situations
-   Astral Nature: When dealing damage, roll 1d20 for random Elemental damage dealt
-   Burden: disadvantage on Accuracy, -1 Unit of Movement per Action
-   Burnable: able to catch fire; can be used as fuel
-   Conductive: conducts electricity
-   Depletion Death: upon reaching 0 durability, will explode dealing  X damage
-   Empower: empowers Myrr(M)/Psi(P)/ other(X) abilities; (+\#d\# \[auto \#]) to abilities
-   Enchant bonus: have X # of enchants that don't affect durability
-   Etherbane: able to interfere with certain ether abilities (like phase and shift)
-   Hydrate: expose material to water for desired effect
-   Luminious: emits light
-   Myrrsync: channels Myrr to make attacks stronger, draining user myrr
-   Myrrpool: contains its own usable Myrr reserve
-   Non-Ferrous: resistance (corrosion); non-magnetic
-   Reflective: 50% incoming damage of type is reflected back to attacker
-   Regen: able to restore self-durability
-   Static-Sponge: absorbs electricity
-   Symbiote: can bond to a wearer; effects can be avoided if certain precautions are met
-   X-Grav:
	-   High: increase gravity
	-   Low: reduces gravity
	-   Anti: 0 gravity resistance
