## Player Inventory
The player has access to 2 different inventories as they play: Basic Inventory and Quick Access Inventory

### Basic Inventory
There is no defined Base Inventory section (use a Notes Page). In Combat, if player wants to use an item not in their QAI, ask the GM first. 

### Quick Access Inventory
Items in this Inventory (Page) are available to use in combat  
Most items have one of 3 states:
-   Equipped
	-   Item able to be used
	-   Properties applied
	-   For Wearables: Block from Armor stat naturally applied
	-   Durability lowered when attacked/damaged
-   Queued
	-   Unusable unless swapped
	-  Properties not applied
-   Underlining
	-   Blocks certain effects of Equipped items from self (ex. Damage)
	-   Properties normally not applied

There are 4 sections:
-   Battle Satchel
-   Accessories
-   Wearables
-   Wieldable Items and Weapons

#### **Wieldable Items**
-   Items that are usually held are put into this section
-   Weapons, Ammo, and other items people usually hold can be used here

#### **Wearable Items**
-   Items that are usually worn are put into this section
-   Clothing, armor, extremities, and other items people usually wear can be used here

#### **Accessories**
-   Trinkets, jewelry, and related items are usually put into this section
