# Basics

During play, players roll for initiative (order of play), then use one of 2 combat styles.

Note: During play players may encounter socio-emotional combat, where words and emotions are the attacks and defenses. Strategically using social skills and emotional conditions (with at least a little roleplay) will allow players to win the "battle". Socio-emotional combat follows the same action economy rules as regular physical combat.

# INITIATIVE

Players roll for group awareness
-	Everyone rolls perception, instinct or wisdom
-	Player group is summated, “Others” group is summated
	-	If there are multiple “other” groups, make each groups rolls separate from the other groups
-	Compare group rolls to see turn order
-	If the group that goes first has roll total that has at least a 50 point difference (in comparison to any group), they gain roll advantage for the first round

# NORMAL COMBAT

In your turn
-	To use ability:
	-	make sure you have enough AP/BP to use
	-	Roll Accuracy:
		-	Default: You roll to affect target (roll with ACC), target rolls to dodge (does not apply to self targeting abilities)
		-	If dodge is higher, no Power roll and no resource is used/added
		-	If hit is higher, roll for Power and resource is used/added
	-	Special: Some abilities have specific accuracy role rules; follow them.
		-	Roll Power
		-	follow prompts for the ability
		-	roll for ability strength/ damage
	-	To move:

# SPEED COMBAT

Rounds are divided into segments:
-	Allies (Players, Friendlies,) and
-	Enemies;
-	Neutrals can be played on either side or as their own group

**Players Rules:**
-	Have people plan out their Actions; and in what order
-	Order can include bouncing back and forth between players
-	Limited amount of time for move planning (set time beforehand) by the GameMaster
-	Player AP/BP is not pooled
-	After planning phase, actions are played out in order players’ time out on (the order players choose at the moment of time-out)

**Enemy Group Rules: \[Creature] Collective**
-	Group a large number of enemies (of the same type) into several parts (5 units Max per part)
	-	Individuals must be the same entity and have the same stats, equipment, armor, etc
	-	These are known as Collectives
-	Individual HP becomes combined into 1 unit for collective
-	When Damage equal to 1 individual's HP is dealt to group, group loses 1 individual
-	With AOE attacks, damage is calculated from units affected; total damage is then pooled into the Collective
-	Collective Max AP is pooled and grows by 4 for each individual in the Collective; 20 AP Max(5 units)
-	Multiple individuals in group can attack at once
	-	can count as multi-hit or CombineDamage
	-	characters using the same move count as X AP per entity attacking
-	Collective moves as one entity (same speed)
