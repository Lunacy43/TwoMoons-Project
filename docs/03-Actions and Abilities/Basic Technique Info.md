## Repertoire
Each player has a repertoire of all the techniques they can use. 
Available Player Techniques: 
-	20 Main Technique slots
	-	These abilities are numbered 1 through 20
-	4 Cursed Technique slots
	-	These abilities are numbered 1 through 4

## Gaining Techniques:
During Character Creation, players can choose up to 8 viable techniques.
When training, players can choose to gain a new technique instead
-	use roll towards a new technique 
	-	\> \[die roll 4] = success in learning

## Forgetting:
You can remove most techniques at anytime
When you gain a new technique while your repertoire is full, you must remove another non-curse technique
You remove 1 random non-curse technique every time you die (roll 1d20 till you hit a non-curse target)

## Cursed Techniques:
Can only be removed from repertoire via special means
Can be forced into your repertoire without your consent
Cursed tech goes into curse slots first
- When your cursed slots are full, a random empty non-curse slot is used
- If there are no empty non-curse slots, it replaces a random non-curse techniques instead (roll 1d20)
#### Cripple
Cripple can only be applied to non-curse techniques 
 -  On a normal application, roll 1d20 till you hit a non-curse target
Affected techniques are still usable but have all scalings reduced to the lowest value
Cripple can stack on the same technique
- Cripple can stack infinitely
- Removing cripple from a technique removes one stack, not all stacks
- Per full day of extended rest, one technique has one stack of Cripple removed
