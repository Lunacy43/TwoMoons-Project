# Enchantments
________________________________________
________________________________________

## Main
Enchantments are essentially properties “encoded” into whatever material they are affecting; they are also constantly active. 

Enchanting however, reduces object stability. 
-	If used on an item, Removes 5 MaxDurability per Enchantment application/upgrade (per stack if a stacking enchantment)
-	If used on an entity, removes CON \[4(B)=1(M)] (per stack if a stacking enchantment)
Removing the enchantment(s) does not restore the loss.

Note: Enchantments can only be done and undone by Enchanter Class.
