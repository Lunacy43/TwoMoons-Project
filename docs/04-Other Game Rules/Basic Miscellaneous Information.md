# Basic Miscellaneous Information

### Distance
-	Distance is measures in units
-	1 unit is equal to 1 meter (~3 feet)
-	Movement Speed Modifier equates as moveable distance in meters

### Rounding Down
-	When dealing with calculations, a general rule of thumb is to assume that all fractions are rounded down.

### Item Creation
-	\[Durability] on creation equal to 1d100 roll (unless otherwise stated)

### Over Time Effects 
-	Heals (\[HOT]): tick at the start of a turn
-	Damage (\[DOT]): ticks at the end of a turn

### Gravity and Falling
#### Falling info
-	“Moving from a higher to a lower level, typically rapidly and without control.” (Oxford dictionary)
-	Base info
	-	If an entity has fallen, for every 5 units (~15.5 feet) it takes 1d10 force/bludgeon. 
	-	To note: 
		-	< 5 units = no fall damage
		-	6 units of falling counts as 5 units of falling, 12 units counts as 10 units, etc.
	-	At the end of the fall entity can take up to 50d10 damage 
-	Other conditions
	-	If falling over 50 units entity gain enforced prone
	-	If falling over 100 units, entity has a chance to go unconscious upon taking damage at fall’s end.

### Emotional and Non-Emotional rolls
-	Non-emotional
	-	With most rolls the aim is to roll high to critical succeed
	-	Advantage is the highest result of 2 or more of the same roll
	-	Disadvantage is the lowest result of 2 or more of the same roll
-	Emotional
	-	With Emotional rolls, the aim to to roll low
	-	Advantage is the lowest result of 2 or more of the same roll
	-	Disadvantage is the highest result of 2 or more of the same roll
